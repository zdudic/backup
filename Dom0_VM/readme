Backup a VM in standalone Dom0 (OVS Oracle Virtual Server)

Intro
------

The script backup_dom0_vm.sh can be used for this purpose. 
It takes snapshot of a VM's disk boot image (no other disks at this moment), then backs up that snapshot to some other location.
The script takes three mandatory arguments: a VM name, image retention in counts and backup path.

Requirement is that a VM disk image is file Dom0:/OVS/${vm}/${vm}.img
The /OVS is ocsf2 and its tool reflink is used to take a snapshot of disk image.

This tool can be run manually or as cron job.

Usage
------
Usage: backup_dom0_vm.sh   
 
Conditions:
VM disk image must be Dom0:/OVS/<VM>/<VM>.img
VM cfg must be Dom0:/OVS/<VM>/<VM>.cfg


Example:

# crontab -l
# backup ldap02
#Usage: backup_dom0_vm.sh   
25 02 * * * backup_dom0_vm.sh ldap02 5 /import/vm-backup/Dom0/

Logs
-----

The script logs are in /var/log/backup_dom0_vm.sh/
